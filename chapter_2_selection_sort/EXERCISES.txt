Suppose you're building an app to keep track of your finances.
Every day, you write down everything you spent money on. At the end of the monsth, 
you review your expenses and sum up how much you spent. 
So you have lots of inserts and a few reads. 
Should you use an array or a list?

I should use a list, since inserting to a list takes O(1) operations.

Q. @page 33
A. I would use a linked list.
The orders will be read sequentially anyway, and there will be a lot of insertions and deletions.
