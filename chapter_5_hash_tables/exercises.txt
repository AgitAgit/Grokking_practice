1. None. This is a bad hash function

2. Use the length of the string as the index. This is a good hash function for 5.6

3. Use the first character of the string as the index. This could be good for 5.5 and 5.7. Bad for 5.6.

4. This would be useful for all of them

5.5: 3,4

5.6: 2, 4

5.7 3,4

The answers say that 2 is also good for 5.7. 
Why is that?
