1.1 
Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you're searching through it using binary search.
What's the maximum nuumber of steps it would take?

It would take log2(128) = 7 steps at worst.

1.2
Suppose you double the size of the list. What's the maximum number of steps now?
The number would be 8, because log2(256) = 8.

Each doubling of the list size would increase the number of steps by 1.

How can I explain this more fully?

log2(x) = y
y = the power to which 2 needs to be raised for it to equal x.

This seems a bit verbose. Is there a more concise explanation of the log function?
From wikipedia:
"...the logarithm of a number x to the base b is the exponent to which b must be raised to produce x.
